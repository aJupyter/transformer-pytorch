## Introduction

🚀 The Transformer Architecture Deep Dive project is your gateway to understanding the revolutionary Transformer model. Dive into the world of self-attention mechanisms and witness how Transformers have redefined natural language processing and beyond.

## Components

### Embedding

🎨 The embedding module, the artistic cornerstone of the Transformer, transforms input tokens into vibrant, continuous vector representations. Explore the Embedding Code to witness the creation of token embeddings that bring life to information representation.

### MultiHead Attention

🌐 MultiHead Attention, the global conductor of attention mechanisms, allows Transformers to harmonize different parts of input sequences simultaneously. Immerse yourself in the MultiHead Attention Code to appreciate the symphony of attention enhancing model performance.

### Encoder

🔍 The Encoder module, a meticulous observer, processes input sequences and captures contextual information through self-attention. Uncover the Encoder Code to see how the Transformer learns to discern relationships within the data.

### Decoder

🔮 The Decoder, a magical storyteller, generates output sequences using both self-attention and encoder-decoder attention. Experience the enchantment behind sequence generation in the Decoder Code.

## Usage
